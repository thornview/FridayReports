# FridayReports

This is a web-based tool for tracking support technician service calls to assigned locations.  
The program includes daily visit log, monthly visit calendar, quick visual of overdue visits,  
a customer satisfaction survey module, and a few other built-in reports. 

The system is built on the CodeIgniter framework with a MySQL database back end.
